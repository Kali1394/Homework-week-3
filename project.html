                    <p class="my text-justify">L'Ambroisie (French pronunciation: [lɑ̃bʁwazi]) is a traditional French
                        restaurant in Paris, France founded by Bernard Pacaud and now run by his son Mathieu that has
                        maintained three Michelin stars for more than thirty years. The name "L'Ambroisie" ("Ambrosia"
                        in English) comes from Greek mythology and means both "food for gods" and "source of
                        immortality."
                        <br><br>The restaurant is in a period house on the southwestern corner of the Place des Vosges
                        in Paris. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Place des Vosges was an upper-class and noble
                        neighborhood.

                        <br><br>The interior of the restaurant is basically unchanged for over 100 years, and the style

                        Monsieur-le-Prince in the Odéon area, near the Jardin du Luxembourg. Its name derives from the
                        cream desserts it served in former decades.
